## Chapter 1: Why Terraform
__The rise of DevOps__   
Applying DevOPs practices can reduce _lead times_ significantly for an organization.  
There are four code values in the DEvOps movement: Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing (sometimes abbreviated as the acronym CAMS).  

__What is infrastructure as code__  
There are four broad categories of IAC tools:
1. Ad hoc scripts - Bash Script, Python, Ruby.
2. Configuration management tools - Ansible, Chef, Puppet and SlatStack.
3. Server templating tools - Docket, Packer and Vagrant.
4. Orchestration tools - Terraform, CloudFormation and OpenStack Heat.
