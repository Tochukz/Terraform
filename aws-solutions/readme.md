# AWS Solutions
The AWS Solutions are cloud solution implementations done using _AWS CDK_ and/or _AWS CloudFormation_. Here I replicate some of those solutions using Terraform.

There are a few Github repositories where the solutions can be accessed:  
1. [AWS Solutions](https://github.com/aws-solutions/)
2. [AWS Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples)
3. [AWS Labs](https://github.com/awslabs)
